# ABSTRACT

**An interactive simulation based physics lab which will help visualize some important concepts of Elementary Physics really easily.**

Simulation modeling explains real-world problems efficiently and in a more precise manner. It provides an important method of analysis which is easily verified, communicated, and understood. Simulation modeling is computer based and uses algorithm and equations. It is much easier to understand something via visualization rather than reading an article or trying to understand it by our own knowledge.

### Example:

#### Concept of collision:
